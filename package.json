DataGrid saves changes immediately after the focus leaves cell.\nTo enable the cell mode, do the following:\n\nSet the editing.mode to \"cell\".\nAssign true to the editing object's allowUpdating, allowAdding, and allowDeleting properties.\n\nThis demo also shows how to delete selected records. Review the onSelectionChanged and deleteRecords functions for implementation details.\n",
